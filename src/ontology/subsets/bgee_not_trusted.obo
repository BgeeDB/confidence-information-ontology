name: low confidence from single evidence
def: "A confidence statement from single evidence related to assertions supported by not-trusted evidence." [Bgee:fbb]

[Term]
id: CIO:0000010
name: confidence statement from strongly conflicting evidence lines of multiple types
def: "A confidence statement from conflicting evidence lines of multiple types, where evidence lines are in strong contradiction, meaning that the supporting evidence lines yield different conclusion, several of them being equally likely to be true." [Bgee:fbb]
subset: bgee_not_trusted

[Term]
id: CIO:0000020
name: confidence statement from strongly conflicting evidence lines of same type
def: "Confidence statement from conflicting evidence lines of same type, where evidence lines are in strong contradiction, meaning that the supporting evidence lines yield different conclusion, several of them being equally likely to be true." [Bgee:fbb]
subset: bgee_not_trusted

[Term]
id: CIO:0000023
name: confidence statement from weakly conflicting evidence lines of same type, overall confidence low
def: "Confidence statement from weakly conflicting evidence lines of same type, of an overall not-trusted confidence level." [Bgee:fbb]
comment: Different strategies can be used to define the overall confidence level: for instance, it could be defined based on the confidence level of the most trusted evidence, from the set of evidence lines supporting (not contradicting) the assertion; or, it could be defined based on the number of evidence lines supporting the assertion (e.g., 10 congruent low-confidence evidence lines could allow to have an overall high confidence in an assertion, even if contradicted by one other low-confidence evidence). It is the responsibility of annotation teams to define and communicate the parameters, pertinent to their field, allowing to produce overall confidence levels.
