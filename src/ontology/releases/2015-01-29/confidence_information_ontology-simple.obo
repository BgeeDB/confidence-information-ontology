def: "A statement providing information about the confidence in an assertion, meaning, an information about the level of certainty that an assertion is correct." [Bgee]
comment: Quality and confidence are distinct concepts: quality refers to the value of a source or of an annotation, whereas confidence refers to the level of certainty that an assertion is correct.

comment: We distinguish two levels of conflict: weak conflict between evidence lines, e.g., a low confidence evidence negating an assertion, versus several high confidence evidence lines supporting the assertion; and strong conflict between evidence lines, e.g., two high confidence evidence lines contradicting each other. Note that strongly conflicting evidence lines are not used to produce confidence information statements associated to a confidence level (low, medium, high): in that case, the supported assertion is believed to need further validation, as evidence lines yield different conclusions of similar confidence.

def: "A confidence information related to assertions that have been rejected, for instance, following paper retraction, author misinterpretation, or curator misinterpretation." [Bgee:draft]
comment: When results are retracted, associated annotations are often removed. Consequently, end-users might not be aware that the result was annotated. Annotating an assertion with this confidence term allows to keep the information available. Such assertions should not interfer with aggregation of multiple evidence lines to generate a confidence level from the branch CIO:0000002 "confidence from multiple evidence lines". This is different from negative annotations, used to negate the interpretation of an annotation. It is also different from conflicting multiple evidence lines, where each single evidence has not been directly invalidated. Rejection is a stronger assertion about an annotation source than conflict, capturing that this evidence should no longer be used.
